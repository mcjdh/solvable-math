# Summary of the Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics, notable for its simple statement yet profound difficulty. It was introduced by Lothar Collatz in 1937.

## Statement of the Problem

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:
*   If the number is **even**, divide it by two.
*   If the number is **odd**, triple it and add one.

Mathematically, this can be defined as a function `f(n)`:
```
f(n) = {
  n/2      if n ≡ 0 (mod 2)  (n is even)
  3n + 1   if n ≡ 1 (mod 2)  (n is odd)
}
```
Starting with any positive integer `n`, form a sequence by repeatedly applying this function to the result of the previous step.

## The Conjecture

**The Collatz Conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen as the starting value.**

Once the number 1 is reached, the sequence enters a cycle: `1 → 4 → 2 → 1 → ...`.

## Example Sequence

Let's start with `n = 6`:
1.  `6` is even, so `6 / 2 = 3`
2.  `3` is odd, so `(3 * 3) + 1 = 10`
3.  `10` is even, so `10 / 2 = 5`
4.  `5` is odd, so `(3 * 5) + 1 = 16`
5.  `16` is even, so `16 / 2 = 8`
6.  `8` is even, so `8 / 2 = 4`
7.  `4` is even, so `4 / 2 = 2`
8.  `2` is even, so `2 / 2 = 1`
The sequence for `n=6` is: `6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`.

## Why is it Unsolved? / Difficulties

Despite its simple rules, the Collatz Conjecture has resisted proof for decades.
*   **Empirical Evidence:** The conjecture has been verified by computers for all positive integers up to very large numbers (currently up to \(2.36 \times 10^{21}\) according to Wikipedia [1]), but this isn't a mathematical proof for *all* integers.
*   **Unpredictable Behavior ("Hailstone Numbers"):** The sequences can rise and fall unpredictably, like hailstones in a cloud, before eventually (as far as we know) descending to 1. For example, the number 27 takes 111 steps to reach 1, climbing to a maximum value of 9232.
*   **Possibility of Other Outcomes:** To prove the conjecture, one must show that no starting number leads to:
    *   **A divergent trajectory:** A sequence that grows to infinity.
    *   **A different cycle:** A sequence that enters a repeating loop that does not include 1. So far, the only known cycle is `(4, 2, 1)`.

## Key Terminology

*   **Hailstone Sequence/Numbers:** The sequence of numbers generated by the Collatz process, so-called due to their tendency to go up and down.
*   **Stopping Time:** The number of steps it takes for a starting number `n` to reach 1. For `n=6`, the stopping time is 8. If a number never reaches 1, its stopping time is considered infinite.
*   **Total Stopping Time:** The number of steps for `n` to reach 1 for the *first* time.
*   **Cycles:** A sequence of numbers that repeats. The conjecture implies that the only cycle for positive integers is `(1, 4, 2)`. The existence of any other cycle would disprove the conjecture.

## Notable Quotes

*   **Paul Erdős:** "Mathematics may not be ready for such problems." He also offered $500 for its solution.
*   **Jeffrey Lagarias (2010):** The Collatz conjecture "is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics."

## What Would a Proof or Disproof Require?

*   **Proof:** A rigorous mathematical argument demonstrating that for *every* positive integer `n`, the sequence generated by the Collatz process eventually reaches 1. This would likely involve showing that no sequence can grow indefinitely and that no other cycles (besides 1-4-2) exist.
*   **Disproof:** Finding a single **counterexample**. This would be a starting positive integer `n` for which the sequence either:
    1.  Goes on forever without repeating (diverges to infinity).
    2.  Enters a cycle that does not contain the number 1.
